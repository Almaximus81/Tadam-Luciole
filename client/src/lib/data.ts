        <li>Step away from your desk</li>
        <li>Drink some water</li>
        <li>Take a few deep breaths</li>
        <li>Return with a refreshed perspective</li>

        <li>Identify the smallest possible first action</li>
        <li>Set a timer for just 5 minutes of work</li>

        <li>Choose a different task from your list</li>
        <li>Preferably one that uses different mental skills</li>
        <li>Work on it for 15-20 minutes</li>
        <li>Use the momentum to return to the original task</li>
        <li>Or continue with the new task if you're in flow</li>
